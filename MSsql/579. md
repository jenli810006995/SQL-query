The Employee table holds the salary information in a year.

Write a SQL to get the cumulative sum of an employee's salary over a period of 3 months but exclude the most recent month.

The result should be displayed by 'Id' ascending, and then by 'Month' descending.

Example
Input
```
| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 1  | 1     | 20     |
| 2  | 1     | 20     |
| 1  | 2     | 30     |
| 2  | 2     | 30     |
| 3  | 2     | 40     |
| 1  | 3     | 40     |
| 3  | 3     | 60     |
| 1  | 4     | 60     |
| 3  | 4     | 70     |
```
Output
```
| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 1  | 3     | 90     |
| 1  | 2     | 50     |
| 1  | 1     | 20     |
| 2  | 1     | 20     |
| 3  | 3     | 100    |
| 3  | 2     | 40     |
```

Solution(MSSql):

```
select E1.id,
       E1.month,
       (coalesce(E1.salary, 0) + coalesce(E2.salary, 0) + coalesce(E3.salary, 0)) as salary
from
(
select id,
       max(Month) as Month
from Employee
group by id
having count(*) > 1
) as maxmonth
left join
Employee E1
on maxmonth.id = E1.id
and maxmonth.Month > E1.month
left join
Employee E2
on E1.id = E2.id
and E2.month = E1.month - 1
left join
Employee E3
on E1.id = E3.id
and E3.month = E1.month - 2
order by id asc, month desc
;

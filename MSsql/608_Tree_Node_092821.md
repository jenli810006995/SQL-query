Given a table tree, id is identifier of the tree node and p_id is its parent node's id.
```
+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
| 2  | 1    |
| 3  | 1    |
| 4  | 2    |
| 5  | 2    |
+----+------+
```
Each node in the tree can be one of three types:
Leaf: if the node is a leaf node.
Root: if the node is the root of the tree.
Inner: If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.
 
Write a query to print the node id and the type of the node. Sort your output by the node id. The result for the above sample is:
``` 
+----+------+
| id | Type |
+----+------+
| 1  | Root |
| 2  | Inner|
| 3  | Leaf |
| 4  | Leaf |
| 5  | Leaf |
+----+------+
```
Solution:
```
with cte as
(
  select id, 'Root' as Type
  from tree
  where id in
  (
  select distinct id from tree
  where p_id is null
  )

  union

  select id, 'Inner' as Type -- have children, have a parent
  from tree
  where id not in
  (
    select distinct p_id
    from tree
    where p_id is not null
  )
  and p_id is not null
  
  union
  
  select id, 'Leaf' as Type -- have a parent, no children
  from tree
  where id in
  (
  select distinct p_id
  from tree
  where p_id is not null
  )
  and p_id is not null
)

select id, type from cte
group by id
sort by id
;

```

Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

```
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```
For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.
```
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+
```

Solution(MSSql):
```
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(@N_sal INT) RETURNS INT AS
BEGIN
    RETURN (
    
    select salary = max(salary) from
    (
      select salary, dense_rank() over(order by salary desc) as ranking
      from
      (
        select distinct salary from employee
      ) b
    ) a
    where ranking = @N_sal
        );
END
```
